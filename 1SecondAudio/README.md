## What it does

Mute you after 1 second of audio, is that enough for you to answer ?

If you want to host a lobby, you'll have to ask other people to also install this script.

Toggle ON/OFF: alt+m
if you're not sure in which state you are and you want to know, press f12 and check console, it should tell you which state your are everytime you press alt+m

You can change the timing by modifying the delayBeforeMute variable

## What to download

[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), then add the [userscript](https://github.com/xSardine/AMQ-Stuff/raw/main/1SecondAudio/1Second_Audio.user.js) to it

## Known Issue

It seems there are some problems where it still mute even when toggled off, deactivate the script when you're not using it if you experience this problem. Will try to fix soon.
